By engaging in social learning in diverse contexts, humans learn from others, share their knowledge with others, and even accumulate a body of cultural knowledge over generations. 1.2 Dartmouth College 1.2.1 Functional Imaging and Naturalistic Neuroscience Lab Figure 1.3: Finn Lab Lab Website: https://thefinnlab.github.io/ Principle Investigator: Emily S, Finn Google Scholar Citation: 4298 Post Open Positions: YES Research Theme: What makes us unique? How do our intrinsic traits bias our perceptions and judgments, and how is this reflected in patterns of brain activity? Why might different people arrive at different interpretations of the same experience? My lab’s research combines behavioral, neuroimaging and computational techniques to study individual differences in cognition, especially under rich, dynamic, “naturalistic” stimulation such as watching movies or listening to stories. We are particularly interested in how individuals resolve ambiguity in narratives, and how this process varies with trait- and state-level factors. Representative Papers: As professor: Bandettini, P.

While much is now known about specific aspects of brain function—how we perceive the world, attend to particular details, remember facts and events, make decisions, etc.—much less is known about how these different functions become organised so that, at any given time, we can focus our attention on a particular task (or tasks) based on our current goals and intentions. Our research investigates the mechanisms responsible for imposing this organisation on our thoughts and actions. A key component of our research is the development of computational models of attention and control processes. We use these models to inform the design and interpretation of our empirical work that combines behavioural, functional neuroimaging (fMRI), and scalp electrophysiological (EEG) methods.

Our brains bring forth memories from moments to years ago, taking into account what matters in a given context, to guide our perception, choice, action, and learning. All of this happens in the flux of our ongoing interaction with the external environment and internal mindscape. In the lab, we are fascinated by this proactive and dynamic process of focus at the core of all cognition. We carry out many lines of research, but they share the broad aim of investigating the workings of mental focus and in understanding its role in psychological and brain disorders.
