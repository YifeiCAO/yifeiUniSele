How do our intrinsic traits bias our perceptions and judgments, and how is this reflected in patterns of brain activity? Why might different people arrive at different interpretations of the same experience? My lab’s research combines behavioral, neuroimaging and computational techniques to study individual differences in cognition, especially under rich, dynamic, “naturalistic” stimulation such as watching movies or listening to stories. We are particularly interested in how individuals resolve ambiguity in narratives, and how this process varies with trait- and state-level factors. Representative Papers: As professor: Bandettini, P.

Our brains bring forth memories from moments to years ago, taking into account what matters in a given context, to guide our perception, choice, action, and learning. All of this happens in the flux of our ongoing interaction with the external environment and internal mindscape. In the lab, we are fascinated by this proactive and dynamic process of focus at the core of all cognition. We carry out many lines of research, but they share the broad aim of investigating the workings of mental focus and in understanding its role in psychological and brain disorders.

The traditional method of analysis yields a g-factor, a single summary metric with considerable predictive power. However, this summary metric ignores the developmental origin of the positive manifold. Multiple competing accounts of the origin of the g factor have been proposed, but in the absence of tailored longitudinal data these models cannot be empirically distinguished. One such model, the mutualism model, proposes that positive interactions between cognitive domains facilitate mutual growth. In three different projects we have shown that this model can help explain cognitive development in childhood. We are currently working on various extensions of these findings.

While much is now known about specific aspects of brain function—how we perceive the world, attend to particular details, remember facts and events, make decisions, etc.—much less is known about how these different functions become organised so that, at any given time, we can focus our attention on a particular task (or tasks) based on our current goals and intentions. Our research investigates the mechanisms responsible for imposing this organisation on our thoughts and actions. A key component of our research is the development of computational models of attention and control processes. We use these models to inform the design and interpretation of our empirical work that combines behavioural, functional neuroimaging (fMRI), and scalp electrophysiological (EEG) methods.

We study learning in adults using computer-based tasks. We are interested in how humans acquire new concepts or patterns in data, and how they use this information to make decisions in novel settings. We simulate learning processes using computational models, including deep neural nettworks, that are tasked with similar challenges. We study the brains of humans during learning and decision-making using noninvasive methods such as fMRI and EEG.
