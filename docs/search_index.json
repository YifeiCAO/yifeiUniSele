By combining brain imaging with behavioral tests, he studies the neural basis of these abilities in human subjects. One important research theme is to understand the neural basis of learning in children and to identify ways that neuroscience could help to improve learning in the classroom. In collaboration with clinical colleagues, Gabrieli also seeks to use brain imaging to better understand, diagnose, and select treatments for neurological and psychiatric diseases.

My lab’s research combines behavioral, neuroimaging and computational techniques to study individual differences in cognition, especially under rich, dynamic, “naturalistic” stimulation such as watching movies or listening to stories.

Our brains bring forth memories from moments to years ago, taking into account what matters in a given context, to guide our perception, choice, action, and learning. All of this happens in the flux of our ongoing interaction with the external environment and internal mindscape. In the lab, we are fascinated by this proactive and dynamic process of focus at the core of all cognition. We carry out many lines of research, but they share the broad aim of investigating the workings of mental focus and in understanding its role in psychological and brain disorders.

The traditional method of analysis yields a g-factor, a single summary metric with considerable predictive power. However, this summary metric ignores the developmental origin of the positive manifold. Multiple competing accounts of the origin of the g factor have been proposed, but in the absence of tailored longitudinal data these models cannot be empirically distinguished. One such model, the mutualism model, proposes that positive interactions between cognitive domains facilitate mutual growth. In three different projects we have shown that this model can help explain cognitive development in childhood. We are currently working on various extensions of these findings.

While much is now known about specific aspects of brain function—how we perceive the world, attend to particular details, remember facts and events, make decisions, etc.—much less is known about how these different functions become organised so that, at any given time, we can focus our attention on a particular task (or tasks) based on our current goals and intentions. Our research investigates the mechanisms responsible for imposing this organisation on our thoughts and actions. A key component of our research is the development of computational models of attention and control processes. We use these models to inform the design and interpretation of our empirical work that combines behavioural, functional neuroimaging (fMRI), and scalp electrophysiological (EEG) methods.

We study learning in adults using computer-based tasks. We are interested in how humans acquire new concepts or patterns in data, and how they use this information to make decisions in novel settings. We simulate learning processes using computational models, including deep neural nettworks, that are tasked with similar challenges. We study the brains of humans during learning and decision-making using noninvasive methods such as fMRI and EEG.

I am mainly (but not only!) interested in situations when decisions are based on past experience (a.k.a. reinforcement learning) . My modus operandi consists in modifying reinforcement learning models, so that they can account for human behavior (in other terms, although my work involves building and testing formal models, I still define myself as an experimentalist). In the last few years I mainly investigated two research hypotheses concerning human reinforcement learning: 1. value is learned in a relative scale 2. value is learned in a biased manner In addition to extending the \"relative value\" and the \"learning bias\" frameworks, new lines of research in my team investigate social learning and the experience/description gap.
