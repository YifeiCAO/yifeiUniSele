```
Lab Website: <http://sll.stanford.edu/>

Principle Investigator: `Hyowon Gweon`

Google Scholar Citation: `2811`

Post Open Positions: `YES`

Research Theme: `We learn about the world by drawing rich, abstract inductive inferences that go beyond what we can observe, and much of these observations come from behaviors of others around us. By engaging in social learning in diverse contexts, humans learn from others, share their knowledge with others, and even accumulate a body of cultural knowledge over generations.`

Lab Website: <https://www.shenhavlab.org/>

Principle Investigator: `Amitai Shenhav`

Google Scholar Citation: `5478`

Post Open Positions: `YES _(did not say whether should contact in email)_`

Research Theme: `**Decision-making** research focuses on how we deliberate over costs and benefits of our options (e.g., comparing apples & oranges). **Cognitive control** research focuses on how we exert cognitive effort to overcome our automatic biases (e.g., naming the color a word appears in vs. reading the word itself).`

Principle Investigator: `Nick Yeung`

Google Scholar Citation: `14887`

Post Open Positions: `YES _(encourage contact)_`

Research Theme: `The broad question addressed in our research is how coherent thought and action emerge from processing in the brain. While much is now known about specific aspects of brain function—how we perceive the world, attend to particular details, remember facts and events, make decisions, etc.—much less is known about how these different functions become organised so that, at any given time, we can focus our attention on a particular task (or tasks) based on our current goals and intentions. Our research investigates the mechanisms responsible for imposing this organisation on our thoughts and actions. A key component of our research is the development of computational models of attention and control processes. We use these models to inform the design and interpretation of our empirical work that combines behavioural, functional neuroimaging (fMRI), and scalp electrophysiological (EEG) methods.`

Lab Website: <https://humaninformationprocessing.com/>

Principle Investigator: `Christopher Summerfirld`

Google Scholar Citation: `12223`

Post Open Positions: `YES (encourage contact)`

Research Theme: `My work is concerned with understanding how humans learn and make decisions. We study learning in adults using computer-based tasks. We are interested in how humans acquire new concepts or patterns in data, and how they use this information to make decisions in novel settings.  We simulate learning processes using computational models, including deep neural nettworks, that are tasked with similar challenges. We study the brains of humans during learning and decision-making using noninvasive methods such as fMRI and EEG.`

Research Theme: `My goal is understanding how humans learn to make decisions at the behavioral, computational and neural levels. I am mainly (but not only!) interested in situations when decisions are based on past experience (a.k.a. reinforcement learning) . My modus operandi consists in modifying reinforcement learning models, so that they can account for human behavior (in other terms, although my work involves  building and testing formal models, I still define myself as an experimentalist). In the last few years I mainly investigated two  research hypotheses concerning human reinforcement learning: 1. value is learned in a relative scale 2. value is learned in a biased manner  In addition to extending the "relative value" and the "learning bias" frameworks, new lines of research in my team investigate  social learning and the experience/description gap.  `
