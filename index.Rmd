```
Lab Website: <https://http://sll.stanford.edu/>

Principle Investigator: `Hyowon Gweon`

Google Scholar Citation: `2811`

Post Open Positions: `YES`

Research Theme: `We learn about the world by drawing rich, abstract inductive inferences that go beyond what we can observe, and much of these observations come from behaviors of others around us. By engaging in social learning in diverse contexts, humans learn from others, share their knowledge with others, and even accumulate a body of cultural knowledge over generations.`

### Functional Imaging and Naturalistic Neuroscience Lab

```
Lab Website: <https://thefinnlab.github.io/>

Principle Investigator: `Emily S, Finn`

Google Scholar Citation: `4298`

Post Open Positions: `YES`

Research Theme: `What makes us unique? How do our intrinsic traits bias our perceptions and judgments, and how is this reflected in patterns of brain activity? Why might different people arrive at different interpretations of the same experience? My lab’s research combines behavioral, neuroimaging and computational techniques to study individual differences in cognition, especially under rich, dynamic, “naturalistic” stimulation such as watching movies or listening to stories. We are particularly interested in how individuals resolve ambiguity in narratives, and how this process varies with trait- and state-level factors.`

Principle Investigator: `Amitai Shenhav`

Google Scholar Citation: `5478`

Post Open Positions: `YES _(did not say whether should contact in email)_`

Research Theme: `**Decision-making** research focuses on how we deliberate over costs and benefits of our options (e.g., comparing apples & oranges). **Cognitive control** research focuses on how we exert cognitive effort to overcome our automatic biases (e.g., naming the color a word appears in vs. reading the word itself).`

Lab Website: <https://www.oxacclab.org/>

Principle Investigator: `Nick Yeung`

Google Scholar Citation: `14887`

Post Open Positions: `YES _(encourage contact)_`

Research Theme: `The broad question addressed in our research is how coherent thought and action emerge from processing in the brain. While much is now known about specific aspects of brain function—how we perceive the world, attend to particular details, remember facts and events, make decisions, etc.—much less is known about how these different functions become organised so that, at any given time, we can focus our attention on a particular task (or tasks) based on our current goals and intentions. Our research investigates the mechanisms responsible for imposing this organisation on our thoughts and actions. A key component of our research is the development of computational models of attention and control processes. We use these models to inform the design and interpretation of our empirical work that combines behavioural, functional neuroimaging (fMRI), and scalp electrophysiological (EEG) methods.`

Principle Investigator: `Kia Nobre`

Google Scholar Citation: `32459`

Post Open Positions: `YES _(encourage contact)_`

Research Theme: `Human behaviour is uniquely flexible. Our brains bring forth memories from moments to years ago, taking into account what matters in a given context, to guide our perception, choice, action, and learning. All of this happens in the flux of our ongoing interaction with the external environment and internal mindscape. In the lab, we are fascinated by this proactive and dynamic process of focus at the core of all cognition. We carry out many lines of research, but they share the broad aim of investigating the workings of mental focus and in understanding its role in psychological and brain disorders.`
