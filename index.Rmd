knitr::include_graphics("finnlab.png")
```
Lab Website: <https://thefinnlab.github.io/>

Principle Investigator: `Emily S, Finn`

Google Scholar Citation: `4298`

Post Open Positions: `YES`

Research Theme: `What makes us unique? How do our intrinsic traits bias our perceptions and judgments, and how is this reflected in patterns of brain activity? Why might different people arrive at different interpretations of the same experience? My lab’s research combines behavioral, neuroimaging and computational techniques to study individual differences in cognition, especially under rich, dynamic, “naturalistic” stimulation such as watching movies or listening to stories. We are particularly interested in how individuals resolve ambiguity in narratives, and how this process varies with trait- and state-level factors.`

Principle Investigator: `Kia Nobre`

Post Open Positions: `YES _(encourage contact)_`

Research Theme: `Human behaviour is uniquely flexible. Our brains bring forth memories from moments to years ago, taking into account what matters in a given context, to guide our perception, choice, action, and learning. All of this happens in the flux of our ongoing interaction with the external environment and internal mindscape. In the lab, we are fascinated by this proactive and dynamic process of focus at the core of all cognition. We carry out many lines of research, but they share the broad aim of investigating the workings of mental focus and in understanding its role in psychological and brain disorders.`

Principle Investigator: `Rogier Kievit`

Research Theme: `A striking feature of individual differences in cognitive abilities is that they are universally positively correlated – a phenomenon known as the positive manifold. The traditional method of analysis yields a g-factor, a single summary metric with considerable predictive power. However, this summary metric ignores the developmental origin of the positive manifold. Multiple competing accounts of the origin of the g factor have been proposed, but in the absence of tailored longitudinal data these models cannot be empirically distinguished. One such model, the mutualism model, proposes that positive interactions between cognitive domains facilitate mutual growth. In three different projects we have shown that this model can help explain cognitive development in childhood. We are currently working on various extensions of these findings.`
